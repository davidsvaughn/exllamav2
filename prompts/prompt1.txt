### Context

Here is the context:     
 [ Today i wrote and essay about weither or not you should keep tresures you find in the waters. ]  I thought to use the sunken ship treasure as part of this essay because now everyone knows that they are there. They may think about getting there tresour but how will they know what to do with it. There are certain rules that govern how they can legally obtain those treasures. If they dont follow the set rules the government can bring charges against them and make sure they do not get tresours anymore. That makes sense.
